# 🔐 Okta → AWS IAM Identity Center SCIM Identity Lifecycle Lab

## Overview

This project demonstrates federated authentication and automated identity lifecycle management between **Okta (Identity Provider)** and **AWS IAM Identity Center (Service Provider)** using:

- **SAML 2.0** for authentication  
- **SCIM 2.0** for automated provisioning  
- **Group-based RBAC**  
- **Permission set mapping**  
- **Automated deprovisioning**

This lab simulates a real-world enterprise implementation of centralized identity governance across cloud platforms.

🔁 Identity Planes
1️⃣ Authentication (SAML)

Flow:

AWS Portal → Redirect to Okta → Authenticate → SAML Assertion → AWS

External IdP configured in IAM Identity Center

Okta metadata uploaded to AWS

NameID format set to EmailAddress

SP-initiated login used for stability

2️⃣ Provisioning (SCIM)

Configured in:

AWS → IAM Identity Center → Settings → Automatic Provisioning
Okta → AWS IAM Identity Center App → Provisioning

Enabled:

Create Users

Update User Attributes

Deactivate Users

Push Groups

Result:

Users automatically created in AWS

Groups automatically created in AWS

Membership synchronized

Deactivation enforced automatically

3️⃣ Authorization (RBAC)
Okta Groups

aws-ic-admins

aws-ic-dev

aws-ic-readonly

AWS Permission Sets
Permission Set	AWS Managed Policy
PS-Admin	AdministratorAccess
PS-Developer	PowerUserAccess
PS-ReadOnly	ReadOnlyAccess
Group → Permission Set Mapping
Okta Group	AWS Permission Set
aws-ic-admins	PS-Admin
aws-ic-dev	PS-Developer
aws-ic-readonly	PS-ReadOnly

Each group is assigned exactly one permission set per account.

🧪 Validation
✅ User Provisioning

Created test user in Okta

Assigned AWS IAM Identity Center application

Added user to aws-ic-dev group

Observed:

User automatically created in AWS

“Created by: SCIM” displayed in AWS

Group membership synchronized

Developer role visible in AWS Access Portal

✅ Deprovisioning

User deactivated in Okta

Observed:

User disabled in AWS IAM Identity Center

AWS account access revoked automatically

⚠ Troubleshooting & Lessons Learned
SAML Rate Limiting (429 Errors)

Cause:

Repeated direct hits to /sso/saml endpoint

Rapid retry loops during testing

Resolution:

Use SP-initiated login via AWS access portal

Avoid direct navigation to Okta SAML endpoint

Allow rate limit window to clear

400 Bad SAML Request

Cause:

Direct navigation to /sso/saml without proper RelayState

Resolution:

Always initiate login from AWS Access Portal URL

Infinite Loading / Role Not Displayed

Cause:

Multiple permission sets assigned to a single group

Resolution:

Enforce 1 group → 1 permission set mapping

🧠 Identity Engineering Concepts Demonstrated

Separation of authentication and provisioning planes

SCIM as identity lifecycle data plane

SAML as federated authentication mechanism

Centralized RBAC using group mapping

Just-in-time AWS role assumption

Automated offboarding enforcement

Principle of least privilege

🔒 Security Considerations

No manually created IAM users in AWS

Centralized identity source (Okta)

Immediate access revocation upon deactivation

Reduced credential sprawl

Role-based access control enforcement

🚀 Outcome

Successfully implemented:

Federated SSO

Automated user provisioning

Automated group synchronization

Automated role assignment

Automated deprovisioning

This architecture mirrors enterprise identity federation patterns used in production cloud environments.
